TODO for Sean's Emacs Config
============================

* Remove unecessary packages
* Upgrade to the next version of el-get (or master branch) and make sure most,
  if not all of my packages are set to a stable version. This "so-and-so package
  doesn't work" is getting very annoying.
* Fix auto-complete, the application which spurred this.

* Code formatting
	* Follow Emacs Lisp style guide (on flymake-shell and flymake-python)
* Yasnippet
	* Learn and perfect it
* C++
	* Create a good C++ setup
	* Flymake (CMake flymake is in place)
    * Completion with auto-complete and/or semantic (cedet)
    * Preferably work well with STL and Qt
* Modularize the config
    * Split into different files which get required by init.el
* Emacs goodies
    * Get this package working again
* Emacs code browser (ECB) and cedet
    * Get ECB installed and working (current layout error is plaguing me)
* Rails
    * Get rails setup working properly
    * Document different modes / command
    * Add flymake-sass
    * Ensure ruby, erb, haml, sass, and coffee modes are working correctly
