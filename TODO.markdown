TODO for Sean's Emacs Config
============================

* Auto-complete tags table bug
    * When you don't have a tags table it shouldn't continue to bug you about it
* Open line
    * Fix it
* Rails
    * Get rails setup working properly
    * Document different modes / command
    * Add flymake-coffee and flymake-sass
    * Ensure ruby, erb, haml, sass, and coffee modes are working correctly
* HTML
    * Get nxHtml working correctly
* Emacs goodies
    * Get this package working again
* Emacs code browser (ECB) and cedet
    * Get ECB installed and working
* C++
    * Create a good C++ setup
    * Gotta have flymake
    * Gotta have completion with auto-complete and/or semantic (cedet)
    * Preferably work well with STL and Qt
* Magit
    * Get it to compile and work
* Icicles
    * Add C-n and C-p bindings instead of arrow keys
    * Possibly get scatter to work instantly - failing that, make it
    the default for S-TAB
    * Install LaCarte
    * Improve \*Completions\* display - either smaller or at bottom,
    or a menu
    * Work well with full-ack and textmate-goto-file
    * Open \*Completions\* immediately, possibly with less candidates
