TODO for Sean's Emacs Config
============================

* Auto-Indent Mode
    * Make sure this is working correctly. Cool and useful extension.
* Flymake
    * Get flymake-point working correctly. This is an awesome add-on.
* HTML
    * Get nxHtml working correctly
* Rails
    * Get rails setup working properly
    * Document different modes / command
    * Add flymake-coffee and flymake-sass
    * Ensure ruby, erb, haml, sass, and coffee modes are working correctly
* Check compatibility
    * Aim to be compatibility GNU Emacs 23 and 24 and Aquamacs 2.x (based on GNU Emacs 23) and Aquamacs 3.x (based on GNU Emacs 24)
* C++
    * Create a good C++ setup
    * Gotta have flymake
    * Gotta have completion with auto-complete and/or semantic (cedet)
    * Preferably work well with STL and Qt
* Icicles
    * Add C-n and C-p bindings instead of arrow keys
    * Possibly get scatter to work instantly - failing that, make it
      the default for S-TAB
    * Install LaCarte
    * Improve \*Completions\* display
